# Your job is to implement forward STRIPS breadth-first search (BFS). The same
# code should work unchanged for both demos:
#
# - demo strips: move a robot, collect a keycard, unlock a door, deliver a parcel
# - demo blocksworld: pickup, putdown, unstack, and stack blocks
#
# Do not special-case either demo. In both demos, a state is just a list of
# fact tuples. Examples:
#
#     ("at", "robot", "corridor")
#     ("handempty", "robot")
#     ("on", "a", "c")
#     ("clear", "b")
#
# You do not need to write preconditions or effects. Use these helpers:
#
# - get_initial_facts(problem)
# - get_applicable_actions(problem, facts)
# - apply_action_signature(problem, facts, action)

    Why:
        The same facts can appear in a different order. Sorting avoids treating
        the same state as new just because the list order changed.

    Suggested one-line solution:
